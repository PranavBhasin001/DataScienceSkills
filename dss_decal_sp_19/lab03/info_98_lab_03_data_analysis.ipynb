    "\n",
    "To figure out the value of a parameter, we need data. If we have the relevant data for the entire population, we can simply calculate the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if the population is very large – for example, if it consists of all the households in the United States – then it might be too expensive and time-consuming to gather data from the entire population. In such situations, data scientists rely on sampling at random from the population.\n",

    "> How to make justifiable conclusions about the unknown parameter, based on the data in the random sample? We will answer this question by using inferential thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistic based on a random sample can be a reasonable estimate of an unknown parameter in the population. For example, you might want to use the median annual income of sampled households as an estimate of the median annual income of all households in the U.S.\n",

    "We would like to see whether maternal smoking was associated with birth weight.  To set up our hypothesis test, we can represent the two views of the world using the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null hypothesis:** In the population, the distribution of birth weights of babies is the same for mothers who don't smoke as for mothers who do. The difference in the sample is due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative hypothesis:** In the population, the babies of the mothers who smoke have a lower birth weight, on average, than the babies of the non-smokers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ultimate goal is to make a decision between these two data generation models. One important point to notice is that we construct our hypotheses about the *parameters* of the data generation model rather than the outcome of the experiment. For example, we should not construct a null hypothesis such as \"The birth weights of smoking mothers will be equal to the birth weights of nonsmoking mothers\", since there is natural variability in the outcome of this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis emphasizes that if the data look different from what the null hypothesis predicts, the difference is due to nothing but chance. Informally, the alternative hypothesis says that the observed difference is \"real.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We should take a closer look at the structure of our alternative hypothesis. In our current set up, notice that we would reject the null hypothesis if the birth weights of babies of the mothers who smoke are significantly lower than the birth weights of the babies of the mothers who do not smoke. In other words, the alternative hypothesis encompasses/supports one side of the distribution. We call this a **one-sided** alternative hypothesis. In general, we would only want to use this type of alternative hypothesis if we have a good reason to believe that it is impossible to see babies of the mothers who smoke have a higher birth weight, on average."
